An Asterisk PBX calls statistics gathering tool with Python/Twisted under the hood. Implemented as a Twisted plugin, it works via FastAGI protocol and stores data to the Postgres database. Designed for small callcenter and proven as workable during 2.5 years in production environment (callcenter with 20 operators). It's not being touched since it's developed in march 2010.
